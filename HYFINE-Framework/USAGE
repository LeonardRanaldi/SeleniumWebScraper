                    return defaultdict --> key: {URL insta profile}, value: {list of link ( supported: youtube, facebook, twitter, link.tree )}

2- run simulatoreYou.py
                    getYuoChannelCorrect(defaultdict) correct link scraped in 1-
                    getSocialFromYouChannel(defaultdictCorrect) extract all link scraped in youtube channel

3- run fromDictToDF.py
                    convertKeyDicRegular(d1) rebuild dict in this way: key: user names, delete keys too much long, eliminate any duplicates.
                    sortCriteria(d1) build second dict: {usr_name: [id_Youtube, id_Insta, id_Facebook, id_Twitter]}


MOD 2 (subscraping)


2- run simulatoreYou.py
                    getNewYuotubeChannel(dictYoutubeChannel) taking final dict return new channel scraped from suggested
                    newYouChannel(list,dict) make sure there are no duplicates
                    createDictFromList(list) takes the list created at the previous step and saves it in a defaultdict
                    getSocialFromYouChannel(defaultdictCorrect) scrape external link (twitter, facebook, intagram)


N.B.
This code uses Selenium Web scraper. Therefore it is strongly related to the DOM of the web page you are working on. 

This code worked correctly from day 10/4/2019 to day 4/11/2019 (day the last test was done)
